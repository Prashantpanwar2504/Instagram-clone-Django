Day 1: Created django project
    1. Created application name authentication,
    2. Created application name core,
    3. Created application name common,
    4. Created application name user,
    5. Created a  urls.py in the authentication application,
    6. Register the authentication urls to our project urls.py
        "path('', include('authentication.urls'))".
    7. Registered application in the apps.py file of authentication application,
    8. Created two View name SigninView and SignoutView,

Day 2: Create the Model for the user in user application the project
    1. import AbstractUser from "from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser",
    2. import CustomManager for user from "from user.managers import CustomUserManager",
    3. create a User class and inherit the AbstractUser class,
    4. create field for the user like "picture", "full_name", "email", "first_name", "last_name",
    5. create a setting for the username which will help to user login,
        # which field will be use for username we can use either email or username.
        # if we not provide the USERNAME_FIELD it will take "username" by default
        USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
        REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['full_name', ]
    6. create a object of custom user
        # Accessing Custom User Manager,we define this CustomUserManager in managers.py file into user app.
        objects = CustomUserManager()
    7. create a form.py file in authentication application in our project,
    8. create field in the form "'full_name', 'email', 'username', 'password1', 'password2'",
    9. create a functionality of SigninView and SignoutView in the view.py file of authentication application of our project.


Day 3: Sign In Page.
    1. create a url in url.py,
    2. import view form view.py,
    3. create a class based view SignInView in views.py file,
    4. create a template name,
    5. created a get method,
    6. created a post method.

Day 4: Created sign_in.html.
    1. copy the code of sign_in.html,
    2. copy the images for sign_in page,
    3. creating authentication function,
    4. import authentication function from django.contrib.auth import authenticate,
    5. created two field with same name as email & password,
    6. pass then to authentication function in post function under SignIn View function,
    7. if user is not present in the DB then Authentication function will return none,
    8. if user is present then import login,  we have to log in the user,
    9. from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login,
    10. call the login function and redirect to 'home_feed' view.
    11. create a 'home_feed' view in core app, cuz after login core application will take care of instagram functionality,
    12. create urls.py in the core application,
    13. create new url in urls.py,
    14. now create a new view in core application,
    15. create template in core application,
    16. create a Class Based View HomeView,
    17. template_name = 'core/feed.html'.


"If we want that not one can access the functionality without login this feature will help you to do that."
Day 5: Functionality only logged in user can access the feed.html file.
    1. import a login decorator in urls.py file of core app from django.contrib.auth.decorator,
    2. call this function in path url,
        'login_required(HomeView.as_view())',
    3. open settings.py file and at the end create a setting named " LOGIN_URL = 'signin_view' "
        it will render the request to signin page, if user is not logged in and try to access feed.
    4. redirect the signup page to signin,
    5. redirect the signin page to homefeed,
    6. Signin and Signout feature working perfectly.
    7. now there is a flow if we go to the Home page we will get to the Signin page, but this is
        not what we want.
    8. To get rid of this problem go to the views.py file of authentication application,
        in the SigninView class in get method,
        we will check before render the template_name,
        if the user is already authenticated then we will not,
        render the user to the template_name = "SigninView" or homepage,
        we will send the user to the homefeed.
    9. Do same for the SignoutView in the authentication application,
        cus we don't want that if the user is already loggedin so he will redirect to signout page.

Day 6: Creating Signout View for the user.
    1. creating the signout button  in the feed.html
        Note: never do the signout with the get request methos that is the worst practice
        do with the post request.
    2. Post request in the html is done with the help of form.
    3. Created a new url for Signout the user in the authentication application,
    4. create a signout view in the authentication application.
    5. define a action int he feed.html for sending request to the signout view
            "<form method="post", action="{% url 'signout_view' %}">"
    6. create a post method in the SignoutView
    7. import logout method and call the logout method on user,
    8. redirect the page to signin View.
    9. Now on Day 6 SignIn, SignOut and SignUp Features are working properly.

Day 7: User password Reset using email.
    1. Four step to follow.
        a. PasswordResetView: Ask for the Email,
        b. PasswordResetDoneView: Show him Succeed email message,
        c. PasswordResetConfirmView: Ask to set a new password,
        d. PasswordResetCompleteView: Successfully Reset your password,
    2. Create a new url to pass for the password reset page in the authentication application in out project,
    3. create new url in auth app for show him succeed email message,
    4. create new url in auth app for confirming,
    5. create new url in auth app for completing the process and redirect to signin page,
    6. Creating the Templates for all four view.
    7. creating the view for PasswordRestView to ask for thr Email as name of PRView,
    8. Import PasswordResetView form django.config.auth.views import PasswordResetView
    9. Import PasswordResetConfirmView form django.config.auth.views import PasswordResetView
    10. create a view for confirming the email with the name 'PRConfirmView'
    11. pass a keyword argument to the PRConfirmView url,

Day 8: ConnectionRefusedError at /password/reset/- error and out the handle it.
    we don't define the configuration for the email, we can send email with the help of Django framework.
    first we have to define the configuration for the email.
    1. Open the settings.py file and define the setting for the email,
    2. first setting 'EMAIL_PORT' for email and gmail we use port '587'
    3. second setting 'EMAIL_USE_TLs' = True, this use for encryption of the message stands for the transport
    Layer Security, which work same like SSL with with some extra functionality
    4. third setting 'EMAIL_HOST' = 'smtp.gmail.com', hosting services we want to use for the email.
    5. fourth setting 'EMAIL_HOST_USER' = 'admin ka mail_id', kiske email se email send karna chahate ho,
    6. 5th setting 'EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD' = '', Kuch be rakhna but apna gmail ka real password mat rakhna
    we have to remember two things,
    7. Error: Authentication Required
        [
        SMTPSenderRefused at /password/reset/
            (530, b'5.7.0 Authentication Required.
            Learn more at\n5.7.0  https://support.google.com/mail/?p=WantAuthError t1sm8537145pjo.33 - gsmtp',
            'webmaster@localhost')
        ]
        pass render password to check further.
    8. Username & Password does't Match.
        [
        SMTPAuthenticationError at /password/reset/
        (535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted.

        ]

        gmail can give us this type of error through smtp library.
    9.  if we want to test email sending link feature,
    10. create a new setting for email_backend,
    11. create a new setting for email_file called EMAIL_FILE_PATH,
    12. now create a new url for the password_reset_done_view,
    13. create a new view name with PRDoneView,
    14. import PasswordResetDoneView from django.contrib.auth.views,
    15. restart the server.
    16. Everything will be work fine but, after getting the link in the file when we go to the that link
        and when we type the new password we will get the new error
    17. Reverse for 'password_reset_complete' not found.
        [
        NoReverseMatch at /password/reset/confirm/MTM/set-password
        Reverse for 'password_reset_complete' not found. 'password_reset_complete' i
        s not a valid view function or pattern name.
        ]
    18. create a new url for password_reset_complete
    19. create a new view for password_reset_complete_view.
    20. Every thing is working properly but we are getting email in file.
        every email link will work only one time second time it will become invalid or expire.
    21. if we don't want to create all the views for password reset in the views.py file.
    22. we can call directly view in thr urls.py file by importing all thr password reset view.
    23. Import all the view for password reset view
        from django.contrib.auth.views import (PasswordResetView,
                                       PasswordResetDoneView,
                                       PasswordResetConfirmView,
                                       PasswordResetCompleteView
                                       )
    24. update the urls.
        we can use keyword argument to call templates.
    25. in the use call PasswordResetView.as_view(),
    26. pass template_name in the as_view(), as a Keyworded argument
        path('password/reset/', PasswordResetView.as_view(
        template_name='authentication/password_reset.html',
        email_template_name='authentication/password_reset_email.html'
        )
    27. remove all the class based views from the views.py file.
    28. restart your server and all thing will word properly.
        we don't need to create the class ofr the password reset views we can do this instead.

Day 9: Login via Username.
    1. go to signin template and check for the type fof the input field
    2. Goto email field and change the type of field from email to text cuz we want to login by email and username both.
    3. go to the views.py file and update the email field with "email_username = request.POST.get('email_username')"
    but in the models.py of user we create USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    4. at the end we have to login by email so we need the email of the user although we provide the username.
    5. in the views.py file we can do one thing, we can find the object of user with the help of email_username field and them we can get
    6. import user model in the views.py file from get_user_model
    7. the email of that user with the help if '.'
        user_object = User.objects.get(username = email_username)
    8. getting the email from the user object
        email = user_object.email
    9. restart the server and authentication will word for username.

Day 10: Login by Email.
    1. when thw login is working for the username, so if we trying to login by email it will raise an error
    "DoesNotExist at /
        User matching query does not exist."
        cuz we write code for the username login feature.
    2. To get rid of this error we can use try and catch block.
    3. put the username login code in the try block cuz this is the code which is raising the error
        "try:
            user_object = User.objects.get(username=email_username)
            email = user_object.email
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
            email = email_username  #
    4. restart the server now user cna login by both username as well as email
    5. now in the real instagram if we provide the wrong username/email and password then we got the error.
        "Sorry, your password was incorrect. Please double-check your password"
    6. we can pass the message if the username/email/password are incorrect.
        "if user is None:
            return render(request, self.template_name, context={
                'message': "Sorry, your username or password was incorrect. Please double-check your username or password"})
        "
    7. now in the signin.html template we have to show that message when the email or username or password are incorrect.
    " {% if messages %}
           <div class="alert alert-danger" role='alert'>
                   {{ messages }}
           </div>
      {% endif %}
    "
    8. but this is not the efficient way. we have the different way to do this efficiently.
    9. sending through context is good but not efficient.

Day 11: Messages framework in Django.
    1. we have the messages framework in django through which  we can send message when we redirect or render from one page
        to another page.
    2. first we have to check in the settings.py file that our installed app list have the the application
        'django.contrib.messages'
    3. then check for the Middleware in the settings.py file that present in the list,
        'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware'
        Note: if both the app and middleware not present in the settings.py file then add them.
    4. go to views.py file pf authentication application
        and import messages
    5. add messages in the signin view if the user is none.
    6. now in the signin template check if there is a messages, if there is a message then we need to loop over it, cuz
        django provide add messages method by which we can add as many messages as we want.
            {% if messages %}
                {% for message in messages %}
                    <div class="alert alert-danger" role='alert'>
                         {{ message }}
                    </div>
                {% endfor %}
            {% endif %}
    7. save the changes and username and password incorrect error working correctly.
    8. if we want to show message after login, then goto ur feed.html file in the core application
    9. create a message for login successfully.
        "login(request, user)
        messages.success(request, "Login Successfully, Welcome to Instagram Clone.")
        return redirect('home_feed')"
    10. copy the same code in the feed.html which we used for signin.html
        {% if messages %}
                {% for message in messages %}
                    <div class="alert alert-danger" role='alert'>
                         {{ message }}
                    </div>
                {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}

        Note: message does not show on the page it show only when page redirect.
        that's why when we login only then we can see the login Successfully message on the
        screen, and when we refresh the same page the message will automatically vanish.
    11. some extra work to ask for username in superuser creation. you can see in the Best Practice exercise notes.

Day 12: ModelAdmin register user model in the admin site.
    1. goto admin.py of user application and register the user model,
    2. but we created a custom user so we need to create a ModelAdmin to register the user model.
    3. first we need to import the UserAdmin from django.contrib.auth.admin
    4. create a class for CustomUserAdmin
    5. import UserForm from the authentication application and add the form in add_form = "UserForm"
    6. import CustomUserChangeForm form the authentication application and add the form in "form = UserChangeForm"
    7. Create a CustomUserChangeForm in the Form.py file of authentication application.
    8. import the UserChangeForm in form.py of Authentication app
    "from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserChangeForm"
    9. CustomUserChangeForm.
    "class CustomUserChangeForm(UserChangeForm):
        class Meta:
            model = get_user_model()
            fields = {'full_name', 'email', 'username',}"
    10. Admins.py file of user application
        "class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
            # this add_form comes from this UserAdmin
            # now we need to tell the name of the form we want to user
            add_form = UserForm
            # create a form
            form = CustomUserChangeForm"
    11. Now we need to tell the name of the model for which we created the CustomUserChangeForm
        "model = User"
    12. Now Register the ModelAdmin with name of  CustomUserChangeAdmin
    13. restart the server.
    14.  Now if we click on the username we will get an error.
        FieldError at /admin/user/user/3/change/
        Unknown field(s) (first_name, last_name) specified for User. Check fields/fieldsets/exclude
        attributes of class CustomUserAdmin.
    15. we have three way to get rid of this error.
        set field/fieldsets.exclude attributes in the CustomUserAdmin, we will chose field sets.
    16. what is Fieldsets: when we get our form then in the form all the field we getting are called field sets.
        fieldsets = (
        ('Personal Details', {'fields': ('email', 'full_name', 'username', 'picture')}), # fields we want to change through admin
        ('Permissions', {'fields': ('is_staff', 'is_active')})
    )
    17. add_fieldsets to show # fields we need to fill while creating user through admin panel
        add_fieldsets = (
            ('Personal Details', {'fields': ('email', 'full_name', 'username', 'picture', 'password1', 'password2')}),
            # fields we need to fill while creating user through admin panel
            ('Permissions', {'fields': ('is_staff', 'is_active')})
        )
    18. restart the server.

Day 13: Database Creation of the Project.
    In Django we call one table = one model, one  column = one field
    We are going to define model in core application cuz every functionality og the instagram is in Core application.

    1. Posts table,
        1. create Post model in the core application,
        2. create required field like text, image, user etc.
        3. import User model from get_user_model in models.py file of core application.
        4. create a field for relation between User model and Post model.
            user = models.ForeignKey(User)
        5. pass on_dlt function in case of someone try to dlt the user.
            user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
        6. create two more column for creating post time and updating post time.
            created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
            updated_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    2. Post_comments,
        1. create a Comment model in the core application.
        2.create required fields,
            class Comment(models.Model):
                text = models.CharField(max_length=140)
                post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
                user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete= models.CASCADE)
                created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
                updated_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    3. Post_likes,
        1. create a Like model in the core application.
        2. create required field for the likes.
            class Like(models.Model):
                post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
                user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
                is_like = models.BooleanField(default=True)# this is sure when like object is created it's mean someone like the post
                created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
                updated_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    4. User_followers,
        1. create a Follower model in core app,
        2. create required field.
            class Follow(models.Model):
                user = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='follow_user',  # Reverse Access Error
                                 on_delete=models.CASCADE) # user_id
                follower = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='follow_follower',  # Reverse Access Error
                                             on_delete=models.CASCADE) # follower_if
                is_follow = models.BooleanField(default=True)
                followed_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
                updated_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    5. Provide the string representation to all the  model.
    6. when we run the code we will ge t the error.
        core.Follow.follower: (fields.E304) Reverse accessor for 'Follow.follower' clashes with reverse accessor for 'Follow.user'.

        cuz we provide the same Foreignkey to two different column field in the models.py file Follow model
    7. To get rid of this error we need to provide related_name to the column field.
        user = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='follow_user',  # Reverse Access Error
                                 on_delete=models.CASCADE) # user_id
        follower = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='follow_follower',  # Reverse Access Error
                                             on_delete=models.CASCADE) # follower_if
    8. make migrations for the created model in the core application.

Day 14: creating post without selecting user automatically.
    1. first thing we need to do is to update the user field of Post model, "editable = false".
    2. crete a save method to save current user.
    3. to get the current logged in user we will user the third party package, django-crum
    4. added the MIDDLEWARE to our project setting.
        MIDDLEWARE += ('crum.CurrentRequestUserMiddleware')
    5. now override the save method to get the current logged in user
        user = get_current_user()
        if user and not user.pk:  # is their any user and don't have the primary key of the user then user ko None krdo.
            user = None           # agr if condition nhi chalegi iska matlab current user be h and primary key be h.
        if not self.pk:  # if Post model ke user field ki primary key nhi h to, post model ke user ko current user  assign krdo.
            self.user = user
        super(Post, self).save(*args, **kwargs)  # getting the save method of parent class with the help of super().
    6. migrate the model.
    7. now we can create the post with logged in user but again we can't see the user name .
    8. to get rid of this pproblem we need to create PostModelAdmin which will help us to get the field we want to se on the
    admin panel.
